## Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)

### [a]. Standard Streams in Unix-like Systems

Standard streams are the default communication channels used by processes to interact with their environment. They include standard input, standard output, and standard error.

> What is File descriptor?
> - A file descriptor is a non-negative integer used by operating systems to manage and keep track of open files, pipes, and other input/output(I/O) resources. 
> - File descriptors provide a way for programs to interact with these resources in a consistent manner.

#### 1. **Standard Input (stdin)**

- **File Descriptor:** `0`
- **Purpose:** Used for input to programs.
- **Default Source:** Keyboard or input redirected from files or other commands.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Reading input from the user
  read user_input
  echo "You entered: $user_input"
  ```

#### 2. **Standard Output (stdout)**

- **File Descriptor:** `1`
- **Purpose:** Used for output from programs.
- **Default Destination:** Terminal screen, but can be redirected to files or other commands.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Writing output to the screen
  echo "Hello, world!"

  # Redirecting output to a file
  echo "Hello, file!" > output.txt
  ```

#### 3. **Standard Error (stderr)**

- **File Descriptor:** `2`
- **Purpose:** Used for error messages and diagnostics.
- **Default Destination:** Terminal screen, separate from standard output.
- **Example:**
  ```bash
  # Displaying an error message
  ls non_existent_file

  # Redirecting error messages to a file
  ls non_existent_file 2> error.log
  ```

### Redirecting Standard Streams

#### 1. **Redirecting Output:**

- **To a File:**
  ```bash
  command > file.txt
  ```
  - Redirects standard output to `file.txt`, overwriting the file.

- **Append to a File:**
  ```bash
  command >> file.txt
  ```
  - Appends standard output to `file.txt`.

#### 2. **Redirecting Error Output:**

- **To a File:**
  ```bash
  command 2> error.log
  ```
  - Redirects standard error to `error.log`.

- **Append Error Output:**
  ```bash
  command 2>> error.log
  ```
  - Appends standard error to `error.log`.

#### 3. **Redirecting Both Output and Error:**

- **To the Same File:**
  ```bash
  command > output.txt 2>&1
  ```
  - Redirects both standard output and standard error to `output.txt`.

- **Append Both Output and Error:**
  ```bash
  command >> output.txt 2>&1
  ```
  - Appends both standard output and standard error to `output.txt`.

#### 4. **Using `&>` for Redirection:**

- **Redirect Both Output and Error (Bash-specific):**
  ```bash
  command &> file.txt
  ```
  - Redirects both standard output and standard error to `file.txt`.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Redirecting Standard Output:**
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
   ```
   - Writes "Hello, world!" to `hello.txt`.

2. **Redirecting Standard Error:**
   ```bash
   ls non_existent_file 2> error.log
   ```
   - Logs the error message to `error.log`.

3. **Combining Output and Error:**
   ```bash
   ls /etc /nonexistent_dir > output.txt 2>&1
   ```
   - Lists files from `/etc` and logs errors from `/nonexistent_dir` to `output.txt`.

4. **Interactive Input and Output:**
   ```bash
   cat > user_input.txt
   ```
   - Takes input from the user and writes it to `user_input.txt`.

### [b] Pipelines in Bash

**Definition:**  
A pipeline is a sequence of commands connected such that the output of one command is used as the input to the next. This is achieved using the `|` or `|&` operators.

**Syntax:**
```bash
[time [-p]] [ ! ] command1 [ [|âŽª|&] command2 ... ]
```

**Components:**
- **`|` (Pipe):** Connects the standard output of `command1` to the standard input of `command2`.
- **`|&` (Pipe with Error):** Connects both standard output and standard error of `command1` to `command2`.
- **`!` (Negation):** Inverts the exit status of the entire pipeline.
- **`time` (Timing):** Measures the time taken for the pipeline to execute.

**Return Status:**
- **Default:** The exit status of the last command in the pipeline.
- **With `pipefail`:** The status is the exit status of the last command that failed (non-zero), or zero if all commands succeed.

**Examples:**

1. **Basic Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   ls | grep "file"
   ```
   - **Description:** Lists files and filters the output to show only lines containing "file".

2. **Pipeline with Error Handling:**
   ```bash
   ls |& grep "file"
   ```
   - **Description:** Searches for "file" in both the standard output and standard error of `ls`.

3. **Pipeline with Timing:**
   ```bash
   time ls | grep "file"
   ```
   - **Description:** Measures how long it takes to list files and filter them.

4. **Pipeline with POSIX Timing:**
   ```bash
   time -p ls | grep "file"
   ```
   - **Description:** Reports timing information in POSIX format.

5. **Pipeline in a Subshell:**
   ```bash
   (ls | grep "file")
   ```
   - **Description:** Executes the pipeline in a subshell. Commands inside the parentheses are executed in a separate process.

**POSIX Mode and `time`:**
- In POSIX mode, `time` may be followed by a newline, showing the total time consumed by the shell and its children.
- **TIMEFORMAT Variable:** Used to specify how timing information is displayed.

**Example of `TIMEFORMAT`:**
```bash
TIMEFORMAT="%E elapsed, %U user, %S system"
time ls | grep "file"
```
- **Description:** Customizes the timing output format.

**Last Element of Pipeline with `lastpipe`:**
- If `shopt -s lastpipe` is enabled, the last command in a pipeline may be executed directly by the shell process instead of a subshell.

**Example with `lastpipe`:**
```bash
shopt -s lastpipe
echo "Hello" | read last
echo "Last value: $last"
```
- **Description:** `read` runs in the current shell due to `lastpipe`, so `$last` will have the value "Hello".

### [c] Lists in Bash

**Definition:**  
A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines or commands separated by control operators, such as `;`, `&`, `&&`, or `||`. Lists are used to control the execution flow of commands.

**Syntax:**
```bash
command1 [ ; | & | && | || ] command2 [ ; | & | && | || ] command3 ...
```

**Operators and Their Precedence:**

1. **Logical AND (`&&`)**
2. **Logical OR (`||`)**
3. **Semicolon (`;`)**
4. **Ampersand (`&`)**

**Explanation of Operators:**

1. **Semicolon (`;`):**
   - **Purpose:** Executes commands sequentially, one after another.
   - **Behavior:** The shell waits for each command to finish before executing the next.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     echo "First"; echo "Second"
     ```
     - **Description:** Prints "First" and then "Second".

2. **Ampersand (`&`):**
   - **Purpose:** Executes the command in the background.
   - **Behavior:** The shell does not wait for the command to complete and immediately returns control to the user.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     sleep 10 &
     echo "Background task started"
     ```
     - **Description:** Runs `sleep 10` in the background and immediately prints "Background task started".

3. **Logical AND (`&&`):**
   - **Purpose:** Executes the second command only if the first command succeeds (returns exit status 0).
   - **Behavior:** The second command is executed only if the first command is successful.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     mkdir new_folder && cd new_folder
     ```
     - **Description:** Creates `new_folder` and changes into it only if the folder creation was successful.

4. **Logical OR (`||`):**
   - **Purpose:** Executes the second command only if the first command fails (returns a non-zero exit status).
   - **Behavior:** The second command is executed if the first command fails.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     cd non_existent_folder || echo "Failed to change directory"
     ```
     - **Description:** Attempts to change into a non-existent folder and prints "Failed to change directory" if the change fails.

**Command Delimiters:**
- Commands can be separated by semicolons, newlines, or any combination thereof.
- **Newlines** can be used instead of semicolons to separate commands:
  ```bash
  echo "Hello"
  echo "World"
  ```

**Return Status:**
- **Default:** The return status of a list is the exit status of the last command executed.
- **AND List (`&&`):** The return status is the exit status of the last command in the list. If any command fails, the subsequent commands are not executed.
- **OR List (`||`):** The return status is the exit status of the last command. If any command succeeds, the subsequent commands are not executed.

**Examples:**

1. **Sequential Execution:**
   ```bash
   echo "Start"; ls; echo "End"
   ```
   - **Description:** Prints "Start", lists directory contents, and then prints "End".

2. **Background Execution:**
   ```bash
   long_running_command &
   echo "Command running in background"
   ```
   - **Description:** Starts `long_running_command` in the background and immediately prints "Command running in background".

3. **Conditional Execution (AND):**
   ```bash
   make build && echo "Build successful"
   ```
   - **Description:** Executes `echo "Build successful"` only if `make build` is successful.

4. **Conditional Execution (OR):**
   ```bash
   grep "pattern" file.txt || echo "Pattern not found"
   ```
   - **Description:** Prints "Pattern not found" if `grep "pattern" file.txt` does not find the pattern.
